# University Query Handling System

## Part of Object Oriented Modeling Course(UE16CS401)

## Requirement Specification
### Introduction
A specific application catering to the need of all individuals in an
institution such as universities. It will provide lodging/reporting, answering,
forwarding of complaints from a complainant to the respective responder.

### Background
The most difficult part in an institution is either to get information or
report issues with the management. We look forward to automating this
system so that the whole process is streamlined. The concerned authorities
get the specifics so that they can help students, teaching staff and
non-teaching staff.
- **Why did we pick this ?**
	A simple to use application that allows every user in an institute to
	voice his opinion, provide suggestions, report incidents or lodge complaints.

- **What problem is it solving ?**
	Complaints in an educational institution often go unaddressed. Queries
	are a very slow process. Having a process in place will quicken the
	roundabout time. An interface for the user will make lodging queries much
	easier.

- **How are we solving this problem ?**
	The application will have a few components.
	A frontend web application to provide for easy use of lodging queries,
	business logic that will coordinate the queries along it’s required route, and a
	backend to store, fetch and log data
